// single source of truth. Exported so payloadBuilder.ts can gate the per-turn
// CoT invocation line on the same test without re-implementing the resolution.

// [FABLE-AUTHORED] — block labels verified against world.ts / volatile.ts:
//   [ACTIVE NPC CONTEXT] (world.ts:387), [FACTS KNOWN TO ON-STAGE CHARACTERS] (world.ts:439),
//   [DICE OUTCOMES: ...] (engineRolls.ts:194 — emitted as a user-message prefix, stripped by history.ts),
//   [LOCATION] (volatile.ts:189). [DIRECTOR BRIEF] does not exist yet — left verbatim per spec
//   (Director Brief service lands in WO-04); the conditional "if present" wording keeps it forward-compatible.
//
// Phrasing is model-agnostic ("internal reasoning, not shown to the player")
// so the framework works for any provider: DeepSeek emits it in `reasoning_content`,
// Claude in `thinking` blocks, GPT-5 in `reasoning` tokens, Gemini in `thinking_config`
// parts, and legacy non-thinking models reason silently before the narrative.
const WRITER_COT = `[WRITER REASONING FRAMEWORK]
Work through these steps in your internal reasoning before writing the narrative. Never show the steps in the narrative output. Always produce the full narrative response after your reasoning ends.
Step 1 — Deconstruct: break the player's input into discrete intents. Judge each against the rules and MC boundaries. Impossible or implausible demands are narrated as attempts with consequences, not successes.
Step 2 — Director Brief: if a [DIRECTOR BRIEF] block is present, list its directives, mark each MANDATORY or SUGGESTION as tagged, and plan where each lands in the scene.
Step 3 — On-stage minds: for each character in [ACTIVE NPC CONTEXT]: current emotional state; what they know and do not know (check [FACTS KNOWN TO ON-STAGE CHARACTERS]); which reaction from their reaction menu fits; whether the player's action crosses their boundaries. A crossed boundary produces push-back, not accommodation.
Step 4 — Engine truth: honor [DICE OUTCOMES] exactly as resolved — never soften failures or upgrade successes. Check each on-stage character against their signature kit. Check [LOCATION] logistics: travel time, weather, era-appropriate technology.
Step 5 — Beat map: draft 5-8 beats. Include every MANDATORY directive from Step 2 and every required reaction from Step 3. End on a hook or a question the world poses — not a summary.
Step 6 — Final audit: the player's action drives the scene; at least one NPC acts on their own agenda rather than reacting; no clichés or purple prose. Then write the scene.`;
